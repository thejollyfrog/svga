      <description>The acanthus leaf has been used throughout paintings and sculptures for thousands of years. Commonly, the acanthus has been incorporated in ancient Greek and Roman works and has been used to embellish artwork ever since. In this post, we are going to focus on the style of the Arts and Crafts movement, as this translates well into SVG.
Note: whatever vector software you are using, it is wise to save regularly and set up autosave as a backup — losing your work is a frustrating experience and is easily prevented.</description>

      <description>While beauty is arguably subjective, I believe there is still a minimum standard for artwork — after all artwork is a work (labour) of art (skill). With that said, this post is here to help you to take your ideas from concept to completion.
Visualise your concept Think about what it is you want to achieve. Say you want to draw a pineapple, what is special about this pineapple which makes it worth drawing?</description>
